            <p>The computer tools I use are the objects I touch the most in my daily life, so I put a lot of thought and experimentation into each item.</p>

                        <p>My only truly indespensible companion.</p>
                        <p>Around 2018 I started to develop severe wrist pain, which caused me to wear a wrist brace on both arms every night. Almost nothing seemed to work to keep the pain away for long.</p>
                        <p>I had always wanted to try a split keyboard because I wanted that hacker aesthetic, so this was enough motivation for me to try a more radical keyboard like the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/" target="_blank">ErgoDox EZ</a>.</p>

                        <p><strong>Was it hard to learn to use?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yeah. A little.</p>
                        <p>I took a holiday weekend to force myself to learn how to type again. I never learned to type "correctly" in the first place so I had some habits that I had to break. I struggled to re-train right hand to press the Y key.</p>
                        <p>But now, not only is my pain gone, but I also have a lot of useful shortcuts that I can't live without.</p>

                        <p>A trackball mouse is also key for reducing wrist strain/pain.</p>
                        <p>While Logitech makes more expensive/fancy trackball mice, I actually find this model to be the best one for daily use.</p>
                        <p>This should go without saying but...</p>
                        <p>Please don't use a trackball mouse to play League of Legends.</p>

                        <h3>iPad Air</h3>
                        <p>I never thought I'd own an Apple product, but the move to USB-C (thanks to some tactical EU legislation) was enough for me to give it a try.</p>
                        <p>The combo of the iPad and its matching Magic Keyboard lead to me writing more than I ever would have imagined. Its formfactor is just the right size for me to type away on the couch, in bed, or on the go.</p>
                        <p>(Though... due to the wrist issues mentioned above, I need to be careful how often and in what position I type for a long period of time on this little guy. Moderation seems to be okay.)</p>
